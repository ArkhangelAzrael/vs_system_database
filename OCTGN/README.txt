OCTGN VS SYSTEM INSTALLATION AND SET UP GUIDE
A few posts still seem to show confusion about this fantastic utility! Card database with huge search utility, A quality online interface for free online play or just solo testing!

Sound good?
Then read on. I got ya.

First download OCTGN here:
https://github.com/octgn/OCTGN
https://github.com/octgn/OCTGN/releases


Once you've finished that Click "Add game Feed" Then enter "VS System" in the name field (or whatever you want to call this directory. This title is unique to your computer) Then paste this:

https://www.myget.org/F/mullergames/

in the Feed URL Once you've done this, select VS System (Or whatever you named this section) from the drop down and you should see all the game definitions Muller_Factory has made. find then install Vs. from this list.
Once you've installed, You'll be eager to deckbuild! however you'll soon notice that you have no image files! Gotta have those image files! 

All Marvel card images can be found here:
http://www.mediafire.com/file/bog19wkppe41xo9/VS_Marvel_Card_Pack.v1.0.%255BMuller%255D.o8c/file

All DC card images can be found here: 
http://www.mediafire.com/file/14rcuj4zgr9cloe/VS_DC_Card_Pack.v1.0.1%255BMuller%255D.o8c/file

Once the files are downloaded DO NOT double click them or interact with them directly. Tghese files do not self extract or anything. We are going to use OCTGN to find and allocate the images we need.
So in OCTGN go back to Games Manager. click on vs system and you'll see the option to add image packs. Click this and find the marvel and dc packs you just downloaded. OCTGN will automatically decompress them and update your cardlists.
Once you've added both image packs you are all set to play!
