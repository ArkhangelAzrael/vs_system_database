Big update to MSE! This is an all encompassing update to all the templates from this group as well as the latest version of MSE from their website. This is a stand alone version of MSE. It doesn't need to be installed, you unzip this file to a location on your computer then run magicseteditor.exe from the unzipped folder. I want to remind everyone using these templates to make sure you check mse-game folders to install all the proper fonts. I believe this version is backwards compatible with any older sets you may have saved. Templates included: DC Deck building game (nothing new if you've already got this), VS OG (some changes on the style tab you should check out), VS 2PCG (updated teams for new Symbiote affiliation), VS Remix (larger templates to accommodate MPC orders if you're into that). The last template among the VS Remix styles is a new version of Brian Foley's templates he has used in the past for his blog so shout out to him for providing those. I also want to thank Aaron Mead and Carl Perlas for their input on some of the styling choices.
