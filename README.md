## VS System Database
Here you will find all things related to the old Vs System CCG.

## Table of Contexts

This repo is mostly intended to try and gather traction for a high-res searcheable database of cards, and perhaps in the future something akin to what the NetRunner community has done to keep their game alive (https://netrunnerdb.com/ and https://jinteki.net/). One can dream.

For now, what you will find here is:

 * Database folder:

     - Low-res images of all the official cards
     - High-res images of a few fan sets gathered
     - Vs System Remix Images
     - Booster pack images
     - A JSON and a XLS database of all the official cards (still under update, but already quite workable)
 
* Document folder:
     - All the original FAQs and documents provided by Upper Deck Entertainment
     - Vs System Remix documentantion

* MPC folder:
     - Details on how to create your own proxies using the https://www.makeplayingcards.com/ website (by Brian Foley)

* OCTGN folder:
     - Files and instructions needed to play games using OCTGN (https://github.com/octgn/OCTGN) by Aaron Mead.
     - But also take a look at https://untap.in, which could be a good alternative (and described by Adam Miller here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2239610758/posts/10155705957170759/)

* Templates folder:
     - And if you want to create your own cards, take a look at the MSE zip file, provided by Chris Tillison (and join the VS System Custom Designs group https://www.facebook.com/groups/610247819041513)

## How to contribute

The best thing you can do to contribute is provide high-res scans of original cards OR recreated them using MSE and the original arts (where possible). Even if we don't have good original arts, we can use placeholder art (please make it obvious in the card) or even leave it blank. Anything is better than nothing and everything is appreciated!
